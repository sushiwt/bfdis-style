    <h1>Battle For Dream Island's Style</h1>
    <p>Battle For Dream Island's style has a vibrant style filled with 
        a very solid, distinct color palette.
    </p>
    <h2>Environment</h2>
    <p>Goiky, the fictional location where BFDI takes place, 
        is very barren, despite the solid green grass everywhere. <br>
        There are only a handful of trees surrounding the place, 
        and besides the props that the Announcer (Host of BFDI)
        used for their competitions, there's nothing to see there.
    </p>
    <h2> Objects </h2>
    <p>The objects in the show use smooth eyes, mouth, 
        and limb assets. The show rotates, transforms, and 
        swaps these assets in a sequence to give the objects
        animation.
        The body parts consists of basic shapes like ovals for
        the eyes, circles for the hands, and halved ovals for 
        the feet. (post-BFDI 8)
    </p>
    <p>
        In BFDI 9: Insectophobe's Nightmare, they started using newer,
        more refined limb assets, replacing the more handdrawn assets used
        since the beginning of the show (see table below). They kept using these assets until
        <a href="/bfb">Battle for BFDI</a>, when the creators opted for a handdrawn approach
        to the limbs, mouth, and  eyes.
    </p>

    </table>
    <h2> Thumbnails </h2>
    <p>BFDI used to use the auto-generated thumbnails
        from YouTube, but in early 2017, they changed 
        the thumbnails of every single BFDI and 
        <a href="/bfdia">BFDIA</a> episode.
    </p>
    <p>The new thumbnails changed to a more 
        saturated, colorful style, similar to the thumbnails of
        <a href="/bfb"> Battle for BFB (Season 4b)</a>. It also 
        reflected the events that happened within the show.
