# Overview
When I was rewatching the entirety of BFDI so far, I found it interesting to see 
how much the show changes its style over the years, from the more vibrant shapes 
and colors of BFDI, to a more abstract look of BFB. 

I'm hoping to document the distinct look of each BFDI season via this repository.

(This is merely for fun; something to work on when I get bored.)

(But if you have a meaningful contribution, feel free to share it in the Issues section!)
